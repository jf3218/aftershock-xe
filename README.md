**AfterShock XE (Extended Edition)** is a fork of
[AfterShock](https://code.google.com/archive/p/oaunofficial/) mod for
[OpenArena](http://openarena.ws/) FPS game.

AfterShock is a mod that brings more competitive features and
customization to OpenArena.

The need for this fork arised because the development of AfterShock
stopped and AfterShock developers are currently out of reach, but we
needed to add new features and fix bugs.

AfterShock XE codebase is available @
https://github.com/Irbyz/aftershock-xe
